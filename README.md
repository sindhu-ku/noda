Cleaned-up and improved NODA package (Neutrino Oscillation Data Analysis), a fitting framework for JUNO
(v2.0.0 should give you results as in docdb #10250, see readme of that version for usage)

usage: `run_noda`
You can also add options like these (see `config/fit_configuration_inputs.yaml`): `run_noda --stat_opt=1year`
Make sure to update the common inputs path in the config.

Capabilities:

- Precision measurement of oscillation parameters (Asimov)
- Neutrino Mass Ordering (Asimov)
- Toy MC for above under development
